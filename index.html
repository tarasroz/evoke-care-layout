            We take staff training and development extremely seriously, constantly striving to build on our experience
            and give young people quality care. We understand how important training is so we heavily invest in all our
            staff because we are committed to maintaining competent, skilled staffing and keeping our team motivated.
            Every month, each member of staff receives one-to-one supervision combined with their own personal
            development plan which is regularly reviewed. This gives our residents, their families and external carers
            peace of mind that we are always striving to be the best at what we do.

            Training is not just about attending an occasional educational course; it is an integral aspect of Evoke
            Care. Our senior staff members are a role model for less experienced staff members and are on-hand to teach,
            assist and offer guidance wherever possible. All staff have structured training programmes in place so their
            objectives are clearly set out from the moment they join the team.
            Our day courses and workshops provide staff with invaluable knowledge on numerous subjects especially
            psychological and focussing on preparing the young people in our care for their future, whether that is
            returning to their families, entering a different family or their own independent living.
